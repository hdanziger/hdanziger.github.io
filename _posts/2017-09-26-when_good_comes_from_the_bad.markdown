Last summer (2016) I had one of those nightmare-ish internships. Not just difficult, but hostile and toxic-- the kind your parents hope you'll avoid. I was hired at an online magazine as a content editor. I had dreamed about being a editor at a publishing house, and writing for a magazine seemed like a good first step. We all have to start somewhere, right? 

The beginning of my unpleasant experience started with my search for an internship. I didn't find the position I accepted until beginning of May, and it was not for lack of trying. When I was notified that I had been given the position, I was extactic. So excited, in fact, that I started the next week, and signed on through mid-August. And there would begin the longest summer of my life. 

The structure of this magazine with no funding and no full-time employees was chaotic, to say the least. The CEO (who I commend for her entrepreneurship) had been unable to get her online lifestyle magazine off the ground, so she relied heavily on college students, like me, who would work for free just for the recommendation and skills to put on our resumes. Because of our general lack of experience, there were many gaping holes in what needed to be completed in order for this magazine to even maintain its URL. I began by writing for the magazine, finding articles and publishing Q&A's in order to get bylines. Yet, with creating a newsletter, a functional blog, as well as maintaining many different databases filled with "clients", I was forced to be dynamic. When there were problems, I did my best to step up in order to learn new things and gain experience, and because there was no one else there to do so. During one of my off-assignment escapades, I ended up helping out with the magazine's layout, which was my first exposure to HTML code. I had no idea what any of it meant, but I could see that when I deleted something 'here' I could see it change 'there'. I felt like I had all this power at the tips of my fingers because I could manipulate the way the entire website looked with just a few clicks and key-taps. 

As the summer went on, I began looking forward to messing around on the back end of WordPress and creating layouts for our newsletter, more so than I did writing. I had become a substitute for a tech consultant for a company that lacked, and so badly needed, one. I found much of it to be intuitive, and all around interesting. It made the chaos of the lack of structure slightly more bearable each day. 

So, although I would say it was not my best summer to date, it drove me to look into the tech industry, which led me to the Flatiron School. The ability to create layouts, and manipulate websites started to excite me more than writing ever did. So here I am, a creative writing major-turned coder, hoping that this is the right choice. And I think it is.
