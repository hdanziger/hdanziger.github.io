I found this project very difficult to begin. The idea of building a program from the ground up without it being test driven was daunting to say the least. It took me a few days, and many many video tutorials, to jump in. A lengthy video chat with Corinna finally gave me the courage to dip my toe in and try starting the project. Which also took me a few tries. My first attempt at bundling gems was a complete fail as I forgot to bundle install, and tried to write the gemspec file myself. After meticulously following Avi's video, I was finally on the right track. Once I had the console working, and the code in my CLI file appearing in my terminal, I gained some confidence. I worked really slowly, and had to think on my feet a lot. I felt like by the end of writing this program I had ironed out much of what I had had difficulty with in Ruby up until this point. While being left to tackle this beast completely on my own, I feel like it provided me with the knowledge I was lacking to more fully comprehend Ruby as a language. 

The most satisfying part of the program was watching my program work, but with mistakes. This was satisfying because I felt like the mistakes guided me in the direction of what code was correct. And rather than give me the answer, I had to play around with my code and watch the mistakes change. Each time I ran my code and had a different mistake, I learned how to read these errors and interpret them to help me write the correct code. I also found that scraping, while difficult was incredibly satisfying to get correct. The fact that I could get my terminal to talk to the various websites to which I linked it correctly was really exciting. Scraping is different for everyone and every code and website, and getting it to work properly felt like a major feat. 

While I was terrified of this project, I found it so interesting, and it pushed me to become a better coder.
