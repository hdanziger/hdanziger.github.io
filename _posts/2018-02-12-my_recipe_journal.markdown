The app I created for my Rails portfolio project was a porthole for looking at and creating recipes. While I know the relationship between recipes and ingredients has been exhausted throughout the curriculum, I genuinely have an affinity for cooking, so this project spoke to me on an emotional level as well as a technical level. 

The first real issues I came across were in relation to routes. for some reason i had problems with my redirecting, and eventually confused my program so much that it told me i had redirected it too many times and it couldnt render anything! Not even an error! I felt as though i had beaten the internet with that (not in a good way.) I also struggled a little with the combination of nested routes as well as the usage of a joins table. i found that creating nested resources in tandem with using a joins table tended to get a little muddled, as I wasn't sure when to utilizte the joins table, or the relationship between my two tables directly. after a good screenshare i managed to sort all of it out! 

my favorite part of this project was creating the routes that render the html page. i really like the process of connecting the controllers to the views, because you can quickly see the relationship between the two, and the errors can be challenging but fulfilling to debug. 

I am excited but nervous for the assessment! It will definitely push me to my limits and and ensure that I am writing correct code, and can speak about my program in both an educated and well-informed manner.
