This project was incredibly daunting from the outset. I felt as though I did not have a good enough grasp on this new language to be left to my own devices to create a working app! I stared at my computer screen, unsure of even where to start or how to read the requirements. So naturally, I turned to an expert. I hopped on my first screenshare with a tech coach, and low and behold, I realized i knew more than I had expected. I had grasped concepts I didnt even knew I could comprehend. We worked in tandem and tackled some of my fears, but I quickly felt as though I could stand on my own two feet. Aspects started clicking for me way faster than I thought. It gave me confidence that I could debug and refactor on my own.

But not before long, I figured out what my true challenege for this project would be: creating a resource. I found that I could display a form on my recipes show page, and get the comment to post, but the page would reload. Or I could prevent the default of the submit button, but the comment wouldn't appear. It was one thing or another that tripped me up. But I refused to let it disillusion me. 

With a little hard work, elbow grease, some really good tutorial videos, and help from tech coaches, I was able to conquer my project and feel good about what I was putting out into the world through my app.
