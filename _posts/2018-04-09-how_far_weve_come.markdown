This entry marks the completion of Flatiron! I can't believe how the time has flown, and how much I've learned. Over the past 8 months I have learned how to become self-succifient and self-motivating; two skills that I greatly needed to work on and never thought I would actually achieve. I learned how to manage my time in order to both complete the program while also taking care of myself. I learned how to push myself and not give up when things got hard, and to have more faith in myself that I could teach my brain to think in  a whole new way with completely new material. 

While there were times I felt alone and left to fend for myself, over all I am so thankful that I made the decision to pursue programming through the Flatiron School. The support was immensely helpful, and I truly feel as though they care about my success and my happiness. 

Transitioning from fulltime school in a classroom to the real world and forced to create my own deadlines is not easy. But with the help of Flatiron, I feel more ready than ever to enter the workforce with a whole new approach. I am so lucky for this opportunity and cannot wait for what lies ahead.
