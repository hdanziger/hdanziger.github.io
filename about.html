<p>I started out as a creative writing major at Johns Hopkins University where I cultivated my skills and developed a love for writing and reading. Yet after a few unexpected life experiences, I found myself interested in coding, and I hope to marry the two and find some middle ground. Bringing coding and creativity together. </p>
